# Design and Analysis of Algorithms Laboratory (CS39001)

Welcome to the **Design and Analysis of Algorithms Laboratory** repository ! This repository contains a collection of all algorithms and data structures that I have implemented and analyzed in my DAA lab sessions. It serves as a digital archive of the work done in the laboratory sessions as well as a comprehensive resource for learning and exploring various algorithmic techniques and their complexities.

## üìö Overview
The repository features a wide range of classic and modern algorithms, covering various aspects of algorithm design and analysis.
In this laboratory, you'll find :
- **Algorithm Implementations:** A range of classic and modern algorithms implemented in different programming languages.
- **Data Structures:** Implementations of fundamental data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
- **Complexity Analysis:** Detailed analyses of time and space complexities for various algorithms.
- **Visualization Tools:** Tools and scripts to visualize the behavior and performance of algorithms.

## üñ•Ô∏è Languages Used
The languages used throughout the lab are :
 - C
 - Python
